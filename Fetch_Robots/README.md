A Python script to fetch and display the `robots.txt` file for a given website domain. This tool is useful for developers, SEO analysts, and anyone interested in exploring a website's crawling rules.

---

## Features

- **Protocol Handling**: Automatically tries both `https` and `http` to fetch the `robots.txt` file.
    
- **Retry Mechanism**: Retries failed requests up to 3 times to handle transient network issues.
    
- **Directive Parsing**: Extracts and displays directives such as `User-agent`, `Disallow`, and `Sitemap`.
    
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid URLs, connection timeouts, and network issues gracefully.
    
- **Parallel Requests**: Fetches `robots.txt` using both protocols simultaneously for efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
    
- The following Python libraries:
    
    - `requests`
        
    - `urllib`
        

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
    
2. Run the script in your terminal:
    
    ```
    python fetch_robots.py
    ```
    
3. Enter the website domain (e.g., `example.com` or `www.example.com`) when prompted.
    

### Example

#### Input:

```
example.com
```

#### Output:

```
--- Results for HTTPS ---
robots.txt content:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /

Parsed Directives:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**:
    
    - The script ensures the entered domain is valid and formats it correctly for further processing.
        
2. **Fetching** `**robots.txt**`:
    
    - Uses both `https` and `http` protocols to locate the `robots.txt` file.
        
    - Implements retries to ensure robustness against transient failures.
        
3. **Parsing Directives**:
    
    - Extracts key information from the `robots.txt` file, such as:
        
        - `User-agent`
            
        - `Disallow`
            
        - `Allow`
            
        - `Sitemap`
            
4. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Provides descriptive error messages for issues like invalid domains, timeouts, or connection errors.

## Enhancements (Future Updates)

- Add support for following `Sitemap` links in `robots.txt`.
    
- Implement a GUI for user-friendly interaction.
    
- Provide an option to save the fetched `robots.txt` and parsed data to a file.
